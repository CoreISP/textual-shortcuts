Little shortcut scripts for Textual IRC client

See: https://help.codeux.com/textual/Writing-Scripts.kb
It explains where to add these files, and what to do. (Eg: chmod +x filename.pl)
Once it's in the right folder and has the right permissions, you can simply use them as commands within Textual.
eg: cop.pl = /cop. (Or /cop nickname)
rm.pl = /rm nickname

I'n not much of a programmer; thanks so much to Jim for helping me out with this!
